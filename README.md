This repository contains work done for a capstone project for DS-GA-1001 (Introduction to Data Science) at NYU. The project showcases skills in hypothesis testing, regression models, and classification models. Below is a breakdown of each file you can find within the repository.


1) DS GA 1001 Capstone Project.pdf: This file contains the formal project writeup that contains answers to each question. Each question will discuss preprocessing steps, the thought process behind each method used, and the results which include at least one visualization.
2) Final Codes.ipynb: This is the associated code that relates to each question. This code provides a more in depth analysis through code. Here you can see how I implemented code for each problem. There will also be additional data analysis and data visualization done for each question compared to what was able to be condensed in the formal project writeup.
3) IDS capstone project spec sheet.pdf: This file contains the official project specification sheet. Here, the project context, questions, and data structure is laid out. You can also find a breakdown of each column for the project files in this pdf.
4) rmpCapstoneNum.csv: One of the project data files
5) rmpCapstoneQual.csv: One of the project data files
6) rmpCapstoneTags.csv: One of the project data files
